I successfully developed and implemented efficient binary classification machine learning models for stroke incidence prediction. Leveraging the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) method was crucial for ensuring balanced datasets, which is essential for the formulation of effective algorithms in stroke prediction. I conducted a comprehensive analysis, employing logistic regression and creating a user-friendly web application for stroke risk estimation. The project involved extensive research on stroke, its risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, and recovery. By utilizing cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, I contributed to advancing early diagnosis and intervention in stroke cases, potentially saving lives and improving outcomes for stroke survivors worldwide.
